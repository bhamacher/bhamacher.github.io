# Zera Software Documentation
--------------------------------
 
This page is created and maintained by the software department.
Please note that this website is for internal and external software documentation 
and might only attend to recent developments of software specific topics,
which can be difficult to understand.

Also English is and will be the only available language.

If you are not quite familiar with the new software deployed 
with the devices mt310s2 and COM5003 this is most probably not
the right place to start.

The topic Posts covers recent request, issues as well as common 
questions and answers.
