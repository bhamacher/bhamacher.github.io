## [ZeraVeinPlatform](ZeraVeinPlatform/index.md)
ZeraVeinPlatform describes the complete software stack used in all our new devices.
It includes basically a framework which provides interprocess communication based and 
developed for Qt applications as well as a set of common measurement and GUI modules.
To implement those on an embedded device we are using openEmbedded.
